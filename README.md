# Ruan-Video-Game-Sale-Prediction
A lot of time and money goes into developing video games. With the increasing volume of gaming and 
game-related data, it is important for game creatores to make wiser investment choices.

This is a video game sales prediction system made in Spark using the IntelliJ IDE and 
the Decision Tree Regression Model. I used the platform, genre and publisher of video games to 
predict the price value.

The dataset that was used contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies that I found on the Kaggle website. I used
Jupyter Notebook to clean the dataset by removing null values and columns that will not be needed.
